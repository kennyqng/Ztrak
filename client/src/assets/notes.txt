Week 1: A detailed plan of action with the following:
An overview of the intended application and WHY you feel it’s valuable.

A breakdown of roles by group member.
- Front: Lauren & Kenny
Html: home, signup
Clock
Chart

- Back: Rogelio & Dominador
Mongo db
Axios/API
Routes: "/", "/signup" and/or "/login"



A schedule for completion of various tasks.
- MWF after 6PM

A screenshot of your Jira, Trello, or Project Management Board that shows breakdown of tasks assigned to group members with a schedule.
- Lauren will add Trello

A set of DETAILED screen-by-screen design layouts with annotations describing all UI/UX components and all data relevant to the screen.

On this note, show Slides 26-27 as an example of a UI/UX and Data Flow layout. Tell the class that you’ll expect something akin to these drafts.
- Home 



Week 2: A functioning minimal viable product (i.e., a prototype version of your app that shows the intended function). This should be as close to a working app as possible and include:
A 5-7 minute presentation that discusses what your app is, what it does, and how it works. You will be presenting to instructors and TAs during class.
A screenshot of your Jira, Trello, or Project Management Board that shows breakdown of tasks assigned to group members with a schedule. This should be updated to reflect remaining priorities and completed tasks.

Week 3: A significantly more polished version of the app.
This should literally seem like an app that you would submit.
Include a summary of significant issues faced to date and their resolution.
Provide a detailed description of each person’s contributions.
Submit a detailed plan that describes remaining efforts. This should describe remaining issues like:
Stretch Features
Bugs
Enhancements
UI Polishing

Week 4: The Presentation!
A 7-10 minute demonstration of your app.
More on this as we near closer to the end.
